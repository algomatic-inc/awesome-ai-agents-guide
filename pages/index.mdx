# LLM Agent

We are not sure about the exact definition, but one commonly known definition of "autonomous agent" is the following.

> An autonomous agent is a system situated within and a part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda and so as to effect what it senses in the future.<br/>
> --- Franklin and Graesser (1997)

Additionally, in [Practices for Governing Agentic AI Systems](https://openai.com/index/practices-for-governing-agentic-ai-systems/) published by Shavit et al. (OpenAI) in December 2023, **the degree of agenticness in a system** is defined as follows:

> We define the degree of agenticness in a system as “the degree to which a system can adaptably achieve complex goals in complex environments with limited direct supervision.” 
> Agenticness as defined here thus breaks down into several components:
> - **Goal complexity**: How challenging would the AI system’s goal8 be for a human to achieve and how wide of a range of goals could the system achieve? Properties of the goal may include target levels of reliability, speed, and safety.
> - **Environmental complexity**: How complex are the environments under which a system can achieve the goal? (E.g., to what extent are they cross-domain, multi-stakeholder, require operating over long time-horizons, and/or involve the use of multiple external tools.)
> - **Adaptability**: How well can the system adapt and react to novel or unexpected circumstances?
> - **Independent execution**: To what extent can the system reliably achieve its goals with limited human intervention or supervision?
